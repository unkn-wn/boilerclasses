Materials are at the foundation for all of engineering, as evident by the latest products that we design, to the airplanes that we fly, to the latest smartphones. In fact, breakthroughs with material research are often accompanied by rapid advancements in technology. Thus, it is paramount for all engineers to have an understanding of the structure and behavior of materials. In this class, we focus on the structure of materials, the microstructure connection to mechanical properties, and, ultimately, failure mechanisms. Materials play an important role in both design and manufacturing, which will be addressed in the context of components and extreme environments. Of specific interest will be defects within materials, defect formation/evolution, and their role in strengthening mechanisms. Material anisotropy, micromechanisms, and elasto-plastic properties at the atomic, single-crystal/constituent, and polycrystal-material levels and their use in explaining the deformation and failure characteristics in metals, polymers, and ceramics; failure mechanisms and toughening in composites; structure and behavior of aerospace materials: metal alloys, ceramic-matrix composites, and fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Particular topics will also include: elastic deformation, dislocation mechanics, plastic deformation and strengthening mechanisms, creep, and failure mechanisms; design criteria; special topics. We will attempt to have minimal overlap with AAE 55400, Fatigue of Structures and Materials. Therefore we will not cover fracture, fatigue, or stress concentrators.",

We will explore reactions to, and the results of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global interplays of material cultural exchange.",

Course topics include how the NFL shapes social identities including race, gender, sexuality, and American identity, the connection between football and militarism, the relationship between the NFL and commercialism, the role the NFL plays in the triad of men's violence, among other topics.",

The picture of how the Universe came to be and how it has evolved has recently come into sharp focus. This progress is the result of improved observational techniques that have resulted in high resolution images of very distant galaxies, a more accurate mapping of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe or the high resolution picture of the young universe provided by Cosmic Microwave Background observations. We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations. Our goal will be to provide the students with a broad overview of the current research in Cosmology with an eye toward stimulating the students curiosity about the many questions still awaiting answers in this field.",

        "description": "This course provides a hands-on experience for life science researchers in the bioinformatic analysis of genome-scale data. The various disciplines in the life sciences are generating a wealth of experimental and annotation data. Today's graduate students need experience with modern tools that can help them to access, explore, analyze, interpret and manage the data that they generate in the lab. Students will use the R programming language and packages from Bioconductor, the R bioinformatics project, as their principal tools for this course. Students will develop workflows in R that bridge established algorithms for bioinformatics such as limma, edgeR or DESeq2, incorporating methods to import, QC, transform and visualize genome-scale datasets derived from next generation sequencing experiments. A critical aspect of bioinformatics that is often inadequate is workflow documentation. This course will use Rmarkdown to integrate computer code, data and results to manage complex bioinformatics projects. The class has lecture, lab and distance components. Lectures will focus on the theoretical and biological aspects of bioinformatics analysis using recent examples from the literature. In lab, students will work on programming exercises or projects using published datasets. Advanced students will also have the opportunity to work with their own data. Distance instruction will include R tutorials and videos that students can work through at their own pace (subject to completion deadlines). Particular emphasis will be placed on the theoretical and practical limitations of next generation sequencing data. No prior computer programming experience is required, but it is assumed that students have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of molecular biology and how they relate to complex processes such as gene expression and genome organization.

The ultimate goal of plant pathologists is to reduce the losses caused by diseases, thereby, increasing both the quality and quantity of the world food supply. Plant diseases are caused by the same types of microorganisms that cause disease in animals and humans and, as such, many of the principles that apply to human and animal medicine apply to plant diseases. It is the objective of this course to introduce students to the major types of plant pathogens (plant pathogenic bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and fungi), their basic biology and examples of the types of diseases they cause. It will be expected that students have knowledge in plant pathology.",

The first part covers basic concepts, terminology, procedures and computations of control systems including block diagrams & transfer functions, open-loop & closed-loop control, control system modeling, time response, root locus techniques, design via root locus, and digital control systems. The second part focuses on issues surrounding the building controls: interfacing components such as sensors and actuators, problems encountered, and state-of-the-art solutions for building energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The third part aims to develop students' ability to convert control system concepts into real building control systems. The course provides a hands-on opportunity for students to complete three projects associated with the three primary components during the semester: indoor environmental quality assessment, building HVAC system commissioning and its control analysis, and new control algorithm development for building energy efficiency, occupant health, and individual productivity.",

A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course is split into two semesters of study. The two courses are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on and within game engines. This course introduces students to the fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required.",

Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces that synthesize human and computational ability to attack large complex problems. It is concerned with analytical reasoning, interaction, data transformations, data visualization, analytic reporting, and technology transition. While the different visual analytics applications share common theories and strategies, each of them has its unique data composition, visual representations, and analytical needs and strategies. Through survey and study a broad range of visual analytics applications, students will be able to apply visual analytics on their own applications, analyze and break down a complex analytical problem into proper components and steps, evaluate different visual analytic techniques and strategies, and finally design and develop an effective visual analytics solution toward the problem.",

Two practical benefits of randomization are its simplicity and speed. Deep and important computational complexity connections have been developed,  from bridging the gap between discrete and continuous optimization, bypassing deterministic barriers in online settings, summarizing massive data in polylogarithmic space, probabilistically checkable proofs, privacy enhancing techniques, modeling the web and other large networks, and sparsifying and compressing complicated combinatorial structures such as graphs. Randomization is an essential  key ingredient in the algorithmic breakthroughs today and in the future. This course presents the basic concepts in the design and analysis of randomized algorithms and shows how to apply them to algorithms for a wide range of problems. The course covers a broad range of problems benefitting from randomized computation including data structures, graph algorithms, online algorithms, geometric algorithms, streaming algorithms, derandomization techniques, and tools for probabilistic analysis of algorithms.",

In a sense, this class will be a bridge to help you transition to other language-intensive courses at Purdue where you need to read, write, and speak frequently and/or work in groups (such as business, engineering, literature, public speaking, and social sciences).",

Students will explore what it means to be ethical in and through an interrogation of our contemporary conceptions of what it means to be human. These interrogations in turn will prompt us to reconsider human creations such as knowledge, culture, and technology, which will push us to genuinely think how humans as a species situate their creations within the realm of what they call Nature. Students will be introduced to the history of environmental studies in the discipline, to the rise of what is now known as \"postcolonial ecocriticism\" to theoretical inquiry into modern technology, and to other recent developments in the fields of environmental studies.",

        "description": "This course provides students with opportunities to study how engineering is intertwined with larger economic, social, cultural, and technological dynamics in an era of intensified globalization. Its major goals are to help students understand and appreciate what engineering is, how engineers are trained, what engineers do, and how engineering and society interact. The course approaches these themes through discussion of: the relation and interaction of engineering, science, technology, and society; the historical origins and development of engineering as a profession; diversity issues in engineering and other STEM fields; engineering in cross-national/cultural contexts; and contemporary challenges related to globalization, ethics, and sustainability. In summary, the course is designed to help students understand what it means to identify as, and/or work with, engineers. Recitation sections and/or independent projects (at the instructor's discretion) provide further opportunities for students to expand their knowledge and improve their skills in relation to course themes.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

        "description": "This course is designed to help students more effectively manage self, peers, teams, clients and firms in diverse organizational settings and lead change. People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds, social identities, and experiences, fostering increased attention to diversity and inclusion in an employment and organizational context. [1] For example, women represent over half of the labor for 57% (BLS, 2018) [2] but are severely under-represented at senior management levels and in high-paying technical and professional fields (Kossek & Buzzanell, 2018) [3]. Ethnic and racial minorities are also severely under-represented. The U.S. population is increasingly diverse as 40% of the population identifies as racial or ethnic minorities (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) including African-American (13.4%), Hispanic-American (18.3%), Asian-American (5.9%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.3%), and European American (60%) as well as a growing number of individuals who identify with more than one race or ethnicity (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2019) [4]. Further, 26% of the population has some form of disability, and 16% are over the age of 65 (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2018). Many other minority groups can face workplace marginalization challenges such as veterans, minority religious group members (Muslims, Jews, Hinduism; Catholic; Latter-day Saints), immigrants, people with mental or intellectual disabilities, & LGBTQ persons (Stone, Lukaszewski, & Dulebohn, 2020)[5]. When leveraged effectively, these differences in social identity and values can help attract and retain talent, strengthen societal and community economic equality, support organizational and team effectiveness; but when overlooked, or mismanaged, these differences can increase turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career and work-life well-being, and productivity. The class focuses on management of gender and diversity for inclusion and equity from an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective in a workplace context. The goal of this class is to take a multi-level approach to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support the management of gender and diversity toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. We integrate multiple levels and lenses to understand diversity and inclusion. From an individual leadership perspective, we tackle the question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state-of-the-art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes - including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, intersectionality, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking - this affects how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/professional identity boundary management. From an organizational and group perspective, we address the question: \"What are best practices for successful diversity management?\" We will focus on organizational and institutional structures and cultures and their relations to strategies for creating diversity through management practices; how to create an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent and foster innovation and organizational effectiveness across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts.",

The course will start with an overview of linear elastic mechanics, move to rubber elasticity, and then viscoelasticity (concentrating on time-temperature superposition). We will also cover fluid dynamics and the rheology of non-Newtonian fluids. We will conclude with a section on deformation, yield, and fracture mechanisms (focusing on those phenomena that are unique to polymers such as rubber cavitation, drawing, and crazing).",

The focus of the course is on developing the ability to apply a general ethical framework to new and unique situations, including those arising from the global cultural context of modern engineering. The course covers how this ethical framework should be constituted, and provides practice in applying this framework to specific, concrete cases. Together, these components work toward your development as a better engineer and more responsible global citizen. The readings, case studies and exercises are geared towards the development of a well-researched original case study that you will present to the class, which is informed by your past experiences and future aspirations related to engineering.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history of ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associated with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of impact of ASD on the family and society.",

The course will begin with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key domains of impairment in ASD: reciprocal social interaction, language and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD. We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate back to the behavioral features of autism.

In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.",

This course will introduce you to the study of global development and globalization. The primary questions we will address are: What is development? What is globalization and what is its relationship with development? How have the processes of global development produced inequalities among nations, regions, races, genders, and classes? Is there a \"developing\" world and a \"developed\" world? If so, what are their differences and how do they relate with each other? How have some developing countries become more developed than others? What roles do corporations, the state, and civil society organizations play in the processes of global development? How is global development interrelated with the physical environment, inequalities of consumption, and the environmental crisis? How do people resist the inequalities and perceived injustices of global development through global social movements? How are we interconnected economically, politically, culturally, socially, and ecologically with people all over the world? What are the possible futures of development? To address these issues, our focus will be on the developing world, our scope will be global and long-term, our methodology will be historical-comparative, and our perspective will be social-scientific and critical.",

By way of a set of case studies, students will analyze the features of these challenges which make them complex, and seek to explain and find solutions to the problems that arise in each case. Their treatment of the cases will be informed by published research and computer simulation. Students will actively participate in discussions regarding these global challenges, and contribute to the progress of the class using oral and written presentations. The course will culminate with a final project completed by teams composed of students from different disciplines.",

Multiple systems concepts and methods have been developed to address these situations, and typical courses in systems focus on a relatively small portion of the rich assortment of available approaches to addressing systems problems. This course introduces students to multiple systems concepts and methods via readings and class lecture. The students then apply these concepts and methods on team-based projects. The course will emphasize critical thinking about how the concepts and methods are applicable to the problematic situations of the projects and how well the project teams were able to perform the required activities.",
